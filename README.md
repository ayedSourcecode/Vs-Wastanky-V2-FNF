## Mods support
* probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!
* comes with a mod organizing/disabling menu. 


## Atleast one change to every week:
### week 1:
  * new dad left sing sprite 
  * unused stage lights are now used
### week 2:
  * both bf and skid & pump does "hey!" animations
  * thunders does a quick light flash and zooms the camera in slightly
  * added a quick transition/cutscene to monster
### week 3:
  * bf does "hey!" during philly nice
  * blammed has a cool new colors flash during that sick part of the song
### week 4:
  * better hair physics for mom/boyfriend (maybe even slightly better than week 7's :eyes:)
  * henchmen die during all songs. yeah :(
### week 5:
  * bottom boppers and gf does "hey!" animations during cocoa and eggnog
  * on winter horrorland, gf bops her head slower in some parts of the song.
### week 6:
  * on thorns, the hud is hidden during the cutscene
  * also there's the background girls being spooky during the "hey!" parts of the instrumental

## Cool new chart editor changes and countless bug fixes
![](https://github.com/shadowmario/fnf-psychengine/blob/main/docs/img/chart.png?raw=true)
* you can now chart "event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* your song's bpm can now have decimal values
* you can manually adjust a note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* you can change a note's type on the editor, it comes with two example types:
  * alt animation: forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like ugh/stress
  * hey: forces a "hey" animation instead of the base sing animation, if boyfriend hits this note, girlfriend will do a "hey!" too.

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own mod
